#Manipulate Ball

##Description
This is simple exercise to demonstrate the use of jQuery event listeners in manipulating a ball. These include changes in ball colour, to hide/show the ball and to move the ball throughout the four corners of the web browser.


##Technology
The technology used are:

- HTML5;
- CSS;
- Javascript / jQuery 2.2.4.


##How it works

HTML and CSS were used to layout the ball and various buttons. jQuery event listeners were set up to detect user mouseclicks on the buttons and to respond with the corresponding changes to the ball. 

Absolute positioning was used for ball positioning. Windows resizing is also detected and the ball moves within the new boundaries.
